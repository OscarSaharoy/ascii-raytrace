# ascii-raytrace

I wrote this as my first little c project as I have been interested in ray tracing and graphics. Its a simple scene with a ball bouncing next to a light source with the camera revolving around. It contains some basic intersection formulas and a vector class as well as a little batch file for compilation (although I wish I could use make). I think it can run at a decent framerate but won't be replacing game engines any time soon.
