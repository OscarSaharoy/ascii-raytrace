# ascii-raytrace

I wrote this as my first little c project as I have been interested in ray tracing and graphics. Its a simple scene with a ball bouncing next to a light source with the camera revolving around. It contains some basic intersection formulas and a vector class as well as a little batch file for compilation. I think it can run at a decent framerate but won't be replacing game engines any time soon.

You can run it in your command prompt by running make.bat in the directory and then bounce.exe.
